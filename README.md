=== Disclaimer ===

Due to this not being a "Public" API, I have hidden the relevant URL's and associated data to access it.
I have personally showed this to CIG Support, and obtained permission that it is okay to use.
I do not accept responsibility if you attempt to use this, without first obtaining permission from CIG.
